Web Archiving Tools for All
---------------------------

`View the full pywb documentation <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_

**pywb** is a Python (2 and 3) web archiving toolkit for replaying web archives large and small as accurately as possible.
The toolkit now also includes new features for creating high-fidelity web archives.

This toolset forms the foundation of Webrecorder project, but also provides a generic web archiving toolkit
that is used by other web archives, including the traditional "Wayback Machine" functionality.


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 2.x release included a major overhaul of pywb and introduces many new features, including the following:

* Dynamic multi-collection configuration system with no-restart updates.

* New recording capability to create new web archives from the live web or other archives.

* Componentized architecture with standalone Warcserver, Recorder and Rewriter components.

* Support for Memento API aggregation and fallback chains for querying multiple remote and local archival sources.

* HTTP/S Proxy Mode with customizable certificate authority for proxy mode recording and replay.

* Flexible rewriting system with pluggable rewriters for different content-types.

* Standalone, modular `client-side rewriting system (wombat.js) <https://github.com/webrecorder/wombat>`_ to handle most modern web sites.

* Improved 'calendar' query UI with incremental loading, grouping results by year and month, and updated replay banner.

* New in 2.4: Extensible UI customizations system for modifying all aspects of the UI.

* New in 2.4: Robust access control system for blocking or excluding URLs, by prefix or by exact match.


Please see the `full documentation <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_ for more detailed info on all these features.
